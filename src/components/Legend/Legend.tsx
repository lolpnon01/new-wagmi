      <h3>Own a Piece of the Legend</h3>
      <p>
        Since the first matches of his senior career, Ronaldo has awed and inspired millions of fans around the world
        with his dazzling skills, jaw-dropping goals, and incredible list of accomplishments. Cristiano Ronaldo: The NFT
        Collection, commemorating the legacy of one of the best to ever grace the game of football, is the first in a
        series of limited-edition drops. The collection will feature seven of Ronaldo’s most iconic moments — including
        his electrifying bicycle kick — reimagined and immortalized forever as seven CGI-rendered NFT statues with four
        rarity levels: Super Super Rare (SSR), Super Rare (SR), Rare (R), and Normal (N). Go beyond just watching the
        goals, the celebrations, and the glory. Own them!
